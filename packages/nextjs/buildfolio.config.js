        "My journey as a programmer started with a full stack software engineering bootcamp organized by Springboard. After graduating, I stuck around as a peer mentor helping students learn the fundamentals of web development. I also joined Hack for LA as a volunteer software engineer contributing to open source projects including Civic Tech Jobs, where I learned to collaborate with other developers, designers, and project managers. I also built the Tabernacle School and Contra Costa Golf Club websites",

My first creation was Speedrun Chainlink, a beginner's guide to implimenting Chainlink products with smart contracts. Next, I shipped Vaults of Fortune, a contest where players compete for the highest ROI by depositing ERC-20 tokens into ERC-4626 vaults. After that, I shipped Only Buidlors, a dynamic SVG NFT project that uses Chainlink functions to verify membership",
